## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer experienced in building modern web applications using Vue.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the primary data store. This repository is a collection of personal projects, reusable code, and experiments that reflect my approach to full-stack developmentâ€”with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, maintainability, and code quality.

On the frontend, I work with Vue.js to create dynamic, responsive, and component-driven interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. I enjoy crafting UIs that are intuitive and visually polished, leveraging Vueâ€™s reactive system and ecosystem tools like Vue Router and Pinia or Vuex for efficient state management.

On the backend, I use Node.js with Express to build RESTful APIs and server-side logic, focusing on scalability and modular design. MongoDB fits naturally into this stack, allowing for flexible schema design and smooth integration with JavaScript-based tools. Iâ€™m comfortable designing databases, optimizing queries, and structuring backend services to handle real-world application demands.

One of my core passions is writing well-tested, reliable code. I regularly work with testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, and Cypress to ensure that both frontend and backend components behave as expected. I believe in continuous integration, automated testing, and code reviews as essential parts of a high-quality development process.

This repository includes full-stack applications, isolated components, and boilerplates that showcase best practices in development and testing. Whether youâ€™re looking for inspiration, code samples, or potential collaboration, I hope you find value in whatâ€™s shared here.

Thanks for visiting! Feel free to explore the projects, open issues, or contribute ideas. Iâ€™m always open to learning, sharing, and building better software together.
